One day in Berlin, a Hund stole a Bratwurst near the Flughafen.
The Bratwurst belonged to a man in Lederhose who chased the Hund down the Hauptstrasse. 
A woman in a bright Dirndel joined the chase, waving a piece of Brot to lure the dog.
Meanwhile, a Porsche zoomed by, splashing Apfelkuchen crumbs all over the street.
The car was on its way back from the Flughafen, blasting the Klimaanlage because it was a very hot summer day.
Beacuase the person in the porshe lost his Apfelkuchen, he had to rush back to the Baeckerei before it closed. 
He was stopped when he saw a Hund with a Bratwurst begin chased by a Man in Lederhose, a women waving a piece of Brot cross the street. 
The crowd of people and dog did not get out of his way fast enough for him to reach the Baeckerei in time so he drove his Porsche back to his Schloss and sat in his Beirgarten to contemplate what he just saw.
