One day in Berlin, a Hund stole a Bratwurst near the Flughafen.
The Bratwurst belonged to a man in Lederhose who chased the Hund down the Hauptstrasse. 
A woman in a bright Dirndel joined the chase, waving a piece of Brot to lure the dog.
Meanwhile, a Porsche zoomed by, splashing Apfelkuchen crumbs all over the street.
The car was on its way back from the Flughafen, blasting the Klimaanlage because it was a very hot summer day.
The man in the porshe lost his Apfelkuchen and had to rush back to the Baeckerei before it closed but was stopped
when he saw a Hund with a Bratwust being chased by a man in Lederhose and a women waving a piece of Brot crossing the street. 
The commotion ended at a nearby Biergarten, where everyone agreed that only a cold drink could fix the chaos.
