One day in Berlin, a Hund stole a Bratwurst near the Flughafen.

The Bratwurst belonged to a man in Lederhose who chased the Hund down the Hauptstrasse.

Meanwhile, a Porsche zoomed by, splashing Apfelkuchen crumbs all over the street.
A woman in a bright Dirndel joined the chase, waving a piece of Brot to lure the dog.
